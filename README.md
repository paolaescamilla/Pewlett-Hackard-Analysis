### Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to support management prepare for the retiirement process of colleagues in the company. 

The analysis has two parts. The first determines the number of retiring employees per title  while the second identifies employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
The key results are the following:

- Plenty of employees, over the years, took different roles in the company which talks about the high professional development in Pewlett-Hackard. This is definitely an incentive for newcomer employees.
- Reviewing the unique titles of the employees to retire, 'Engineers' has the highest count which talks about two things:
      1. The scope of the company demands experienced, well-trained, operative workforce, and
      2. Human Resources will undergo an important task to balance the hiring of new engineers in order to not unbalance the company's productivity.
- More than 1,500 employees are elegible for retirement. The high number invites us to recommend the company to enforce a well structured retirement program/plan in order to not affect the activity needed for production/productivity.
- The number of titles is highly unproportional. There are a lot of operational titles about to retire and very few in place a manager title. It is recommended to review the distribution of those titles in order to ensure that supervision matches supervisee.

## Summary
To sum up, Pewlett-Hackard has over 1,500 employees about to retire from the company. This demands the company to enforce a mentorship program to ensure the process is as smooth and clear as possible for their employees. 

The first analysis gave us the creation of a "Retirement titles" table which holds all the titles of current employees who weere born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

To consolidate this list, we had to drop all duplicate entries for the employees and keep only the most recent title. This occured because some employees transition to different positions over the years.

Second, a list of eligible employees to a mentorship program was retrieved holding employees with birth dates between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

After this, we recommend the company to review further the following:
(1) The manager titles is strongly low when compared to the available workforce in place. We invite the company to review that the distribution is proportional and the relation of supervisor - supervisee relates.
(2) For this retirement season, a high amount of engineers will be departing from the company. As Pewlett-Hackard is strongly operational, we invite the company to prepare and make sure that the departure of engineers will not affect productivity and daily operations.
